# VinBigData Chest X-Ray Dataset downloader

This project includes a shell script for downloading the VinBigData Chest X-Ray open dataset from Kaggle, using Kaggle's API on the command line interface. The script will create the virtual environment, install Kaggle API and then download the dataset, which will be located in the folder ```dataset```. To do so, one must perform the following commands:
```
chmod +x download_dataset.sh
./download_dataset.sh
```

Enjoy!
